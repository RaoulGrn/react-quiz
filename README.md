# Quizzy

This project was made with React and Vite. The sole purpose of this project was for me to learn React State Management, useState, useReducer, etc.
The result? A 15 questions timed quiz regarding React and some of its functionalities.


# Setup 
### Use "npm install" in root folder
### Write "npm run server" and "npm run start" in the same root folder. The "back end" is only a script that loads our questions from a json file.
Enjoy!
